<h3 class="title">Sakura</h2>
<p2>
        Sakura is the Japanese term for cherry blossom – that most beautiful
        of Japanese flowers.  In particular, the prunus serrulata, or Japanese
        cherry, is native to Japan as well as Korea and China.

       In Japan it blooms between the end of March and early May, depending on
       location, with each tree’s blossoms only lasting for a couple of weeks.
       The first trees to flower are found in Okinawa in January, while those
       in Tokyo flower at the beginning of April.

      The tree produces the pinky-white flowers which are so well-known from
     Japanese art. Sakura doesn’t just have immense cultural significance in
     Japan, it has a massive economic influence as well. Around sakura season,
     shop windows fill up with cherry blossom-adorned wares. And despite the
    word ‘cherry’ being part of the tree’s name, cultivated sakura often do
    not bear fruit – it is the all-important blossom for which they are prized.
