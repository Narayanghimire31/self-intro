<h2 class="title">About my country of origin</h2>
  <p>
    Nepal is a beautiful country in the laps of the
    Himalayas and is well known all over as a world.
     Nepal is the country of Lord Buddha,it is
     the homeland of the brave Gorkhas, a country
     bestowed with maximum cultural and natural decorum.
      Very few places on earth can rival the beauty and
      rarity of Nepal. The beautiful snowcapped mountains
      in the north, the high and lowland valleys and the plain,
       fertile land of the Terai all these have proved
        to be a boon of nature to Nepal.

    Edicated to Lord Shiva, Pashupatinath is one of the four
     most important religious sites in Asia for devotees of
    Shiva. Built in the 5th century and later renovated by
    Malla kings, the site itself is said to have existed
    from the beginning of the millennium when a Shiva lingam
    was discovered here.

    The largest temple complex in Nepal, it stretches on both
    sides of the Bagmati River which is considered holy by Hindus.
    The main pagoda style temple has a gilded roof, four sides
    covered in silver, and wood carvings of the finest quality.
    Temples dedicated to several other Hindu and Buddhist deities
    surround the temple of Pashupatinath.
